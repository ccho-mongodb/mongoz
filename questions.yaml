questions:
  
  - text: In which directory would you like to store your server log file?
    hint: "Provide the full path to an existing file that the server can store
      all the server log information. This includes information on connections,
      database commands run, initialization, changes in the replica set, and
      recovery information. To fine-tune the log, visit the following page:
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#systemlog-options"
    default: /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log
    conf_path: systemLog.path 
    auto_set: 
      - value: file
        conf_path: systemLog.destination
      - value: true
        conf_path: systemLog.logAppend

  - text: What is the IP address or hostname of your server?
    hint: "If you are planning to run the server from your computer, use
      'localhost'. Otherwise, use the hostname of the remote server on which
      you host the MongoDB replica set to avoid downtime when the IP address
      changes. To simplify hosting your database and minimizing downtime in
      many situations, try hosting on the cloud with MongoDB Atlas
      https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas" 
    default: localhost
    conf_path: net.bindIp

  - text: What port do you want to run your server on?
    hint: "MongoDB server binds to a port on your server to make itself
      accessible over the network. The default recommended port is 27017, but
      you may use any value between 1024 and 49151, the 'registered port' range
      that is generally available for use. If another application is running
      on the port you specify, MongoDB will not start up."  
    default: 27017
    conf_path: net.port
    validate: port_number

  - text: Do you want to run the server in the background?
    hint: "MongoDB server can run as a 'forked process' which means that it
      will not block the terminal session from which you start your server.
      One disadvantage is that you will not be able to see the error messages
      if your server fails to start up correctly unless you check the log."
    default: true
    conf_path: processManagement.fork
    validate: boolean

  - text: In which directory would you like to store the database data?
    hint: "Provide the full path to an existing directory that the server can
      store all the data in your database. Make sure the user under which the
      mongod process will be run has write permissions to this directory. If
      you are uncertain that you have enough disk space, consider serving data
      from the cloud with MongoDB Atlas https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas"
    default: 
    conf_path: storage.dbPath

  - text: What is the path to your server certificate file?
    hint: "In order to keep data that is passed along the network secure, TLS
      encryption is highly recommended as the client authentication protocol.
      These certificates use a cryptographic standard called x.509 which is
      also used to establish TLS connections to secure websites. The server
      certificate file is used to verify the server's identity to its clients.
      Please specify the full path to the server certificate file, signed by a
      certificate authority. This feature is offered as a service and can be
      automatically activated when you use MongoDB Atlas https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas"
    default: cert_dir/myserver.pem
    conf_path: net.tls.certificateKeyFile
    auto_set:
      - value: requireTLS
        conf_path: net.tls.mode
      - value: enabled
        conf_path: security.authorization

  - text: What is the path to your certificate authority file?
    hint: "As part of the x.509 cryptographic standard and TLS protocol, a
      certificate authority must sign a certificate to establish that it is
      a trusted certificate. The certificate authority (CA) file is used to
      sign the server and client keys. Provide the path to the CA file here.
      This feature is offered as a service and can automatically be activated
      when you use MongoDB Atlas https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas."
    default: cert_dir/mycert.pem
    conf_path: net.tls.CAFile
    auto_set:
      - value: requireTLS
        conf_path: net.tls.mode
      - value: enabled
        conf_path: security.authorization
